# Subpixels Of Your Mind
A "Subways Of Your Mind" SNES PAL MSU-1 Tech Demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_scN5HeSGWc

Note: This demo has been fully tested on the Mesen and Snes9x emulators. It hasn't been tested on SD2SNES, though the file structure should allow the demo to be played on it.

How to compile:
1. Download WLA-DX: https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx
2. Make sure your PATH variable is properly configured and run the "compile.bat" script
3. If everything went alright, a file "fex_msu1.sfc" should appear. The demo is now ready to be played on Mesen/Snes9x/SD2SNES.
